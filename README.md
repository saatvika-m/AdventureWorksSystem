# Adventure Works System
Problem statement:

Adventure Works Cycles wants a checkout system that enables users to edit and create orders. The users should be able to view and search for all the products. They also want a dashboard to view analytics of their products.

Proposed Solution:

I used Power Platform which is a low/no code platform used to build apps to design and build the app itself. I used Power Automate to create flows and Power BI to create the dashboard (All further explained down below).

Different Users:

 - Administrator - Admin team
 - Customer - Creates the orders
 - Line manager - Approves the orders
